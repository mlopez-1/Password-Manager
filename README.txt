Menu Guide:

When the program runs, it will prompt you for a master password (currently just for proof of concept, need to fully implement later)

Master Password options:
1. Typing 'master' will give you access to the rest of the menus:
   - 1. Create new password
   - 2. Read password
   - 3. Exit
   To create a new password, type '1' and follow instructions
   To read, type '2' and follow instructions
   To exit, type 3'

2. Typing exit will stop the program

3. Typing anything else will prompt for master pass again
